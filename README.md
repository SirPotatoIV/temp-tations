    # Temp-Tations

## Description 
This application is an elegant solution for searching for a recipe based on the user’s local temperature. Users can search for main ingredients and the application will return a list of recipes appropriate for the current temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing, the app will return more soups, baked goods, casseroles, and comfort foods. If it is very warm outside, more grillable foods, cold salads and blended beverages will appear.

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use the application.  

## Usage
The usage was for our group to practice our CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills. We also had to use two different apis that we did not use in class and could not use Bootstrap styling. 

## Credit
We created this project from the outline given to us by our Triology Education Services instructor. We also took code from our homework and in class activities. Paul Hendrickson helped come up with the idea of having an application use weather data to help pick recipes. We have also cited other sources within our Javascript, HTLM and CSS.  

## Contributing 
We built this application with our assigned group, Jake O'Toole, Mary Jacobs, Mark McGraw and Patrick Brown. We also had help from our instructor and TAs.

## Challenges
As a group we found it difficult and nerve racking to have all four of us "pushing" and "pulling" our Git repository. It was hard to place our own code and have it successfully interact with our groups code. We also had to use new terminal commands that we haven't used before. It took us awhile to get confortable trusting the process. Mary mentioned that using Balma as our CSS framework had different class names such as "is-ancestor" and "is-child" which took awhile to remember. Mark and Patrick said that the apis was difficult to use because the documentation wasn't thorough.  Mark had to use trial and error while setting up his queryURL and Patrick commented that he had to read all of the documentation for the food api to make sure he understood which pieces of information he would need for his functions.
